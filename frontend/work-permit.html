      <h2>What is a Work Permit?</h2>
      <p>
        A work permit, officially known as an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), allows certain noncitizens in the U.S. to work legally for a specified period of time. It is issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and is often available to those with pending immigration applications or humanitarian status.
      </p>

      <h2>Who May Be Eligible?</h2>
      <p>
        Eligibility for a work permit depends on your current immigration status or pending application. Common categories include:

        <li>Adjustment of status applicants (green card applicants)</li>
        <li>DACA recipients (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)</li>
        <li>TPS recipients (Temporary Protected Status)</li>
        <li>Spouses of certain visa holders (e.g., L-2, E-2, H-4 with approved I-140)</li>
