      <h2>What is a Family-Based Petition?</h2>
      <p>
        A family-based petition is the first step in helping a relative immigrate to the United States. It is used by U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) to sponsor eligible family members for permanent residency (a green card).
      </p>

      <h2>Who Can File and Who Can Be Sponsored?</h2>

      <h2>Immediate Relatives vs. Family Preference</h2>
      <p>
        Immediate relatives (spouses, unmarried children under 21, and parents of U.S. citizens) are not subject to annual visa limits, making the process generally faster. Other relatives fall under the family preference system, which has annual numerical caps and longer wait times.
      </p>

      <h2>What Do the Family Preferences Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        The family preference system is used to allocate a limited number of immigrant visas each year to certain qualified relatives. These categories are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>F1 – First Preference:</strong> Unmarried sons and daughters (21 or older) of U.S. citizens</li>
        <li><strong>F2A – Second Preference A:</strong> Spouses and unmarried children (under 21) of lawful permanent residents</li>
        <li><strong>F2B – Second Preference B:</strong> Unmarried sons and daughters (21 or older) of lawful permanent residents</li>
        <li><strong>F3 – Third Preference:</strong> Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens</li>
        <li><strong>F4 – Fourth Preference:</strong> Brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens (if the petitioner is at least 21)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because there are limits on the number of visas available each year in these categories, applicants often face long wait times. The U.S. Department of State publishes a monthly Visa Bulletin that shows which priority dates are currently being processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Estimated wait times can vary significantly by category and country of origin. On average:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>F1:</strong> 7–10 years</li>
        <li><strong>F2A:</strong> 2–3 years (but sometimes current)</li>
        <li><strong>F2B:</strong> 6–9 years</li>
        <li><strong>F3:</strong> 12–15 years</li>
        <li><strong>F4:</strong> 14–20+ years</li>
      </ul>
