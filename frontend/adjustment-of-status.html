      <h2>What is Adjustment of Status?</h2>
      <p>
        Adjustment of Status (AOS) is the process that allows certain noncitizens already in the United States to apply for lawful permanent residence (a green card) without having to return to their home country for consular processing.
      </p>

      <h2>Who May Qualify?</h2>
      <p>
        You may be eligible to adjust status if:

        <li>You have an approved immigrant petition (such as Form I-130 or I-140)</li>
        <li>You have an immigrant visa number available</li>
        <li>You are not subject to certain bars to adjustment (e.g., unlawful status, criminal history, fraud)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Eligibility Scenarios</h2>
