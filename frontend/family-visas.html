      <h2>What Are Family-Based Visas?</h2>
      <p>
        Family-based immigration allows U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) to petition for certain relatives to join them in the United States. The process begins with filing Form I-130 to establish the qualifying relationship.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Immediate Relatives of U.S. Citizens</h3>
      <p>These visas have no annual limit (how many the government allows) and typically process faster:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spouse (IR-1)</li>
        <li>Unmarried child under 21 (IR-2)</li>
        <li>Orphans adopted abroad or to be adopted in the U.S. (IR-3 / IR-4)</li>
        <li>Parent of a U.S. citizen (if the citizen is 21 or older) (IR-5)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Family Preference Categories</h3>
      <p>These visas are subject to annual limits (how many the government allows) and longer wait times:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>F1: Unmarried sons and daughters (21+) of U.S. citizens</li>
        <li>F2A: Spouses and unmarried children (under 21) of green card holders</li>
        <li>F2B: Unmarried sons and daughters (21+) of green card holders</li>
        <li>F3: Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens</li>
        <li>F4: Siblings of U.S. citizens (sponsor must be 21+)</li>
      </ul>
